You’re working in the `Signatar.app` project. At the moment the GIF export uses a single `animationType` (fade-in, pulse, etc.) and completely ignores the element‑specific animations defined in `elementAnimations`. This is outdated—the export should animate each element (logo, headshot, social icons) according to its own setting and remove the global animation entirely.

Tasks:
1. Open `client/src/components/gif-generator.tsx`.
2. Change the `GifGeneratorProps` interface so it accepts `elementAnimations: ElementAnimations` instead of a single `animationType`.
3. Inside `GifGenerator`, default `elementAnimations` to `{ headshot: "none", logo: "none", socialIcons: "none" }` if it’s undefined.
4. In the `renderSignatureFrame` function (currently around line 220), remove all logic that uses `animationType` to animate the entire canvas.
5. For each element in the “sales-professional” template:
   - **Logo:** Look up `elementAnimations.logo`. If it is `"fade-in"` set the logo’s opacity to `progress` (0–1). If it is `"zoom-in"` start the logo at 50 % size and scale it up to full size as `progress` goes from 0 to 1. Otherwise keep it opaque and unscaled.
   - **Headshot:** Same: use `elementAnimations.headshot` to set the opacity or scale when drawing the headshot image.
   - **Social Icons:** Use `elementAnimations.socialIcons` to set the group opacity (fade-in) or fall back to no animation. A zoom effect can simply be treated as fade for now.
   Apply these parameters by saving the canvas context (`ctx.save()`), setting `ctx.globalAlpha` and/or performing a `ctx.scale()` transform around the element’s centre, drawing the image/text, and then restoring the context.
6. Delete or ignore `animationType`, as all animations are now controlled per element.
7. If other templates (e.g. “minimal”) should support per‑element animations, apply the same pattern to their drawing routines.

After these changes, running the GIF generator should produce exports where each element animates according to its assigned effect, and the global animation field is no longer used.
